# SupplyChainAnalytics
Data Toolset for Supply Chain Analytics

Currently, we only process AIS data.

We plan to also add the following functionality:

1. Tools to gather and cleanse relevant data,
2. Use these data set for various purposes (e.g., arrival time, travel time prediction),
3. Reliable transport times,
4. Competitive transport costs,
5. Robust alternative back-up routing to cope with incidents and capacity constraints,
6. Investigate the potential for route optimization for reducing time, cost and CO2 emission,
7. Enhancing efficiency by the exchange of shipment of goods between handlers,
8. Investigate various methods for exchange of goods.
